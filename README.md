# Business-Game
This is a simulation project using Shawdow Manager . The idea is to manage a whole virtual company with a realistic &amp; competitive environement.

# $Introduction$ :

Being a member of the management of your virtual company. Starting from an initial situation and a given environment, you will participate in its development.
First of all, you will define your medium-term strategy based on an initial diagnosis of of your company.
Then at each period, you will have to :
- Analyze the situation of your company (accounting, studies,..)
- Adapt your strategy to the situation
- Make operational decisions (finance, marketing, etc.) and postpone them
The Shadow Manager simulator will allocate market shares and produce the final situation
of each company. This situation then becomes the starting point for the next period.
At the end of the session (5 to 6 periods) you will present a management report.

# $About$ $the$ $company$ :

The name of a brand is the identity and DNA of the company in the market and its point of differentiation from the competition. Thus, the name of our company has been carefully chosen to reflect the concept of the company. Inspired by our field of activity, we chose ELECTRONE, a combination of "electronics", which represents our field of activity, and "TRONE" for "throne", which illustrates the unquestionable supreme power that we aim to achieve through our positioning in the market.

Our company "ELECTRONE" is a branch of an international industrial group specialized in electronics for the general public. Its main activity is based on the production and commercialization of electronic security equipment for the general public and for professionals. It is a limited company with a capital of 600.000 €, divided into 6.000 shares of 100€.
At the beginning of our activity, we have alarms whose demand is in decline, and intercoms whose curve is at maturity. Later on, we intend to launch two new products in order to boost the security equipment activity.
Our primary objective is to achieve a significant turnover in all products in order to cover all expenses and to have a profit that can be reinvested.
